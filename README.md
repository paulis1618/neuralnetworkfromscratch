# Neural Network From Scratch
Building a neural network from scratch for educational purpsoses, without any use of libraries such as Tensorflow or Pytorch

Just Numpy

In this repo you will find a gradual guide for neural networks, starting with

Follow along from index0 to index7 for better understanding

### Index0
Implementing the function of a single neuron

### Index1
Implementing a two layer neural network

### Index2
Implementing the class of Dense layer and building a two layer neural network 

### Index3
Extending index2 with ReLU activation function

### Index4
Combining a neural network with ReLU and Softmax activation functions

### Index5
Implementing Categorical Cross Entropy also known as Softmax Loss
